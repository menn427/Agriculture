        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production,aquaculture,and forestry for food and non-food products. Agriculture was a key factor in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in the cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago.Sheep,goats,pigs,and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were indepently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the 20th century,industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output. As of 2021,small farms produce about one-third of the world’s food, but large farms are prevalent. The largest 1% of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares(120 acres) and operate more tha 70% of the word’s farmland. Nearly 40% of agriculture land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hesctares (2,500 acres). Howeever,five of every six farms in the world consist of fewer than 2 hectares (4.9acres), and take up only around 12% of all agricultural land. Farms and farming greatly influence rual economics and greatly shape rural society, affecting both the direct agricultural workforce and broader businesses that support the farms and farming populations.

        <h2 class="sub-header">The story of Agriculture and the Sustinable Development Goals (SDGs)</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Sustinable Development Goals (sdgS) are the blueprint to transform our world, for people, planet and properity,now and in the future.Mre than any other sector, agriculture is the common thread which holds the 17 SDGs together. Investing in the agriculture sector can address not only hunger and malnutrition but also aother challenges including poverty;water and energy use ;climate change ;and unsustinable production and consumption.Together, we must mobilise scientific,technological and social movements to adress these challenges together.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    By 2030 end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations including infants, to safe nutritious and sufficientmfood all year round.Modern agriculture has achieved much over the past century. While the global population has grown from less than three billion people in 1950 to more than eight billion people today, global levels of hunger have not folllowed this trend, remaining largely constant over the same period.
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Tacking hunder is not only about boosting food protuction;it’s also about icreasing inncomes and strengthening markets so that people can access food even if a crisis prevents them from growing enough themselves.The food and agriculture organisation of the united Nations has warned that with just eight years remaining to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, the world is moving in the wrong direction, with sub-saharan Africa as a region and rural women aas a demographic group most at risk.

Achieving nutrition secutity is about receiving the right quantity, quality and diversity of food in one’s diet.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                   1- Biofortified foods;Such as vitamin-A enriched rice or sweet potatoes, are bred to have higher amounts of micronutrients and can help provide essential vitamins and minerales.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                  2-  micronutrient-enriched fertilizers improve soil fertility,helping to support higher yields of more nutritious food and can combat micronutrient deficiencies.
                </p>
                  <p class="article-paragraph">
                    3- Improveed agronomic practices can also help, for instance crop rotation and conservation tillage by encouring food diversity and preventing nutrient depletion of soils.

        <h2 class="sub-header">Productivity and incomes</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other protective resources and inputs, knowledge, financial, services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
             Agricultural development is inextricably linked to economic growth that benefits the poor. In fact, the world bank has estimated that Agriculture development is about two to four times more effective in raising incomes among the poorest than growth from any sector (and up to 11 times more effective in Sub-Saharan Africa). More than three-quarters (77%) of the increased food we will need to produce by 2030 needs to come from increased productivity. 
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Increased productivity, when coupled with better access to markets, address hunger directly at the farm level or provide sufficient additional income to buy food at market. For instance, the agriculture sector accounts for one-third of gross-domenstic product (GDP) and three-quarters of employment in Sub-Saharan Africa.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Egypt’s agriculture sector is entering a new digital era as the counrty sets its sights on food security, economic inclusion and Sustainability.In a world grappling with discrupted food supplies, Egypt stands out as a success story for transforming its agricultural sector with advanced technologies.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                     Globally, the agricultural secror has been slow to embrace digital transformation despite the inefficiencies in current production processes. Currently, only 30% to 50% of what is grown is consumed. To maximize potential gains in production, Bloomberg Green suggests framing existing land more efficiently through mechanization, better needs and crop choices, and improved irrigation. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Digitalizing agriculture involves using advanced technologies and data analysis to optimize the production process, reduce waste and increase profitability, while boosting inclusion in the sector.it’s a tall order, but a challenge that Egypt is meeting.
